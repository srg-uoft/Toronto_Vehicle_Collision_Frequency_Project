################################### Preamble ###################################
# Purpose: A space for generating initial summary statistics and visuals for our  
#           INF2167 project, as a draft space before deciding which blocks of
#           code to run in the ultimate proposal/report

# Pre-requisites: please install the Tidyverse, Here, and Janitor packages on your local 
#                 machine ahead of time, as well as load the project GitHub repository 
#                 as an R project so the relative filepaths will function as intended.

########################### Import Required Libraries ##########################
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(paletteer)

########################### Read In the Dataset ################################
collisions <- read_csv(here("data/02 - analysis data", "working-data-2020-2026.csv"))

############################### Establish Goals ################################
# establish goals: see what months, specific days, specific hours, or neighborhoods, have the most accidents
## also can facet that by mode of transportation to see what that might look like for different modes
# establish goals: in general, see how many accidents there are per mode of transportation

########################## Viewing & Cleaning Data #############################
## classes
glimpse(collisions)
# looks like all columns are either numeric doubles or strings of characters
# doubles include the year, hour, and number of fatalities
# character strings include month name, day of the week, and many different "yes/no" variables
# modes of transportation being separate columns might be tricky, will have to pivot to use mode of transportation as a facet variable

## rename some of the columns to make them easier to understand
collisions_cleaned <- collisions |>
  rename(INJURIES = INJURY_COLLISIONS) |>
  rename(FAILURE_TO_REMAIN = FTR_COLLISIONS) |>
  rename(PROPERTY_DAMAGE_OVER_2000 = PD_COLLISIONS) |>
  rename(NEIGHBOURHOOD = NEIGHBOURHOOD_158)

## changing column names to snake_case using janitor
collisions_cleaned <- collisions_cleaned |>
  clean_names()
head(collisions_cleaned)

## add a new column for month number
months_df = data.frame(name = c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"), number = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12))

collisions_cleaned <- collisions_cleaned |>
  left_join(months_df, by = c("occ_month" = "name")) |>
  rename(occ_month_num = number)

## values
unique(collisions_cleaned$occ_month)
unique(collisions$occ_dow)
# unique values of months and days of the week seem to make sense

unique(collisions_cleaned$occ_hour)
# collisions have occurred in every possible hour of the day

table(collisions_cleaned$fatalities)
# a vast majority of collisions had no fatalities
# 2 fatalities or above could be considered outliers, total of 7 collisions of that caliber in 370000
